 * shell style (#).
 *
 * This file serves to be a drop-in replacement for most sites using
 * sysklogd. For the uninitiated, dsyslog creates a series of streams
 * which go from sources and get routed to many sinks. In between, there
 * are filters, which act on all messages, and conditionals, which control
 * whether or not an output accepts that message. This can be compared to
 * for example syslog-ng's architecture.
 *
 * So, it's a little different than traditional sysklogd.
